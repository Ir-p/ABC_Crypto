# ABC_Crypto
The team of four seasoned and aspired software developers were inspired by ‚ÄúThe Borgen Project‚Äù blog article on [‚ÄúDigital Poverty‚Äù](https://borgenproject.org/digital-poverty/) to develop an educational  cryptocurrency app, ‚ÄúABC Crypto‚Äù. ‚ÄúABC Crypto‚Äù is a free app which guides its users to well-known, established resources on cryptocurrencies. The users can learn anything from what cryptocurrencies are, how to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, the latest news on cryptocurrencies, what most popular cryptocurrencies are and its market prices. ‚ÄúABC Crypto‚Äù allows its users to share their own knowledge and resources about cryptocurrencies, vote and comment on the other users‚Äô resources.
